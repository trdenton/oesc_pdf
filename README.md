Violentmonkey example script to save images from "AriaViewer" reader.  For educational purposes.

probably works with tampermonkey.  Greasemonkey did not work (in firefox).

Navigating to the page will cause the userscript to traverse the document and save every page image to the default downloads directory for your browser.
Note - it does not know when to stop.  It will continue saving the last page until you close the tab.  Keep an eye on it.
